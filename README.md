## üèÅ Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/ai-analytics-platform.git
cd ai-analytics-platform
poetry install --with dev
cp .env.sample .env  # Fill in Postgres, Redis, OpenAI keys

# Run locally
poetry run uvicorn src.main:app --reload
# Or with Docker
docker-compose up --build
# API docs
open http://localhost:8000/docs
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

- **Python 3.11+** required
- Install with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/):

  ```bash
  poetry install --with dev
  ```

- Or use Docker Compose for a full stack (API, DB, Redis):

  ```bash
  docker-compose up --build
  ```

---

## üîê Environment Configuration

All secrets and sensitive configuration must be provided via environment variables. Never commit secrets to version control.

**Required Environment Variables:**

- `SECRET_KEY`: Cryptographically secure key for JWT and session management
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `REDIS_URL`: Redis connection string
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI API key for AI-powered features

Example `.env`:

```
SECRET_KEY=your-production-secret-key
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@db:5432/analytics
REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

For production, use a secrets manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault) and inject secrets at runtime.
